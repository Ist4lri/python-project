For using this project, simply run the "welcomeApp" file. All will be explain, in french.

You can be on a shell terminal, on linux, or you can be on a tkinter application.

You can paste your sequence, or, select a fasta file. You can also select a GTF/GFF file, and use another translation table to make translation ARN to Proteins.

With the Shell App, just answer to the questions, and follow what the PC says.

Enjoy ! 

Only use Fasta, GFF3, GTF, or that can block your transcription, and your translation. This file can be downloaded from NCBI/Ensembl/UNIPROT, ETC
For pasting the sequence, you can paste some sequence take it from NCBI or Ensembl, or just paste a part of a seq.

For giving another table Translation, please, put a file with this format, in txt format :

'UUU'\t'F'\n
...

Spoiler alert, Shell terminal is just so many more faster than the tkinter app

AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand....That's it !!
